## Table of Contents

## PROJECT-1 (V-Profile Project MANUAL and AUTOMATED)
In this project, we are going to set up a web application stack. The name of the project is V Profile Project set up local.
In this project, we will be setting a multi-tier web application stack. The set up will be locally on your laptop or on your desktop.
There are two reasons why we are doing this project.

The first reason is this project is going to set up a baseline for our upcoming projects. We are going to do a lot of projects like we're going to deploy a stack on a.
We're going to refactor it. We're going to containerized our applications. 
We're going to deploy the projects on Kubernetes cluster and many more things to do. All the upcoming projects you need to understand, v profile project first, and for that we are doing a setup on your on our local machine.

The second reason of doing this project is so you can set up your own lab locally. If you have any project you're working in, any project, you can set up that entire stack locally and do all your R&D.

## PROJECT-2 (V-Profile Project on CONATINERS)
In this Project, we will see how to run our Vprofile application on containers. Now this project is more of a trailer of what is coming next in Docker.
Everything is ready made over here. We just need to bring up the VM and run our Vprofile containers on it.
In this project, we will see how these things will run on the container together. We are going to run this entire setup on a virtual machine.
So in the virtual machine, you will have all these containers running and we will access it.
